	"It's much too cold," thought Rahul. He trudged along, trying not to step on the smaller, sharper rocks. As the sun sank lower and the beautiful
violet sky finally revealed itself, he grew less worried about his situation. He was simply present. A moving speck to any observer, slowly scaling a 
snow covered mountain. Yet, his long hair and scraggly beard were evidence of the arduous journey he was undertaking.
	His goal was simple, to reach the top of the great ice mountain before he froze to death. Night was coming, and pretty soon he would have to find
some sort of shelter to keep himself warm for the night. But for now, Rahul kept climbing, unbroken by his cracking dry skin and frostbitten skin. 
Rahul hoped that he would find what he was looking for on top of the mountain, although he didn't know if even that would fix his prediciment.
